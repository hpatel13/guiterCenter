The pick-ups and hardware are sometimes suspect, and the workmanship varies from instrument to instrument, but for the price, these are a very good beginner guitar choice.",

This Pacifica features an agathis body, maple neck, and rosewood fretboard, with two single coil pick-ups, and one humbucker.

First of all, there's a slight buzzing problem on the sixth string; especially if you're not pressing hard. Also, the strings that came on it were very low quality; On several strings I couldn't even get a note below the 12th fret; but I put Elixirs on it and that's fixed.  ",
